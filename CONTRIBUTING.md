# SheSharp Contributing Guide

Welcome to SheSharp Knowledge Hub! Thank you for expressing interest in contributing to this initiative ♥️.

This repository contains a list of resources for growing and improving as a developer. Our goal is to help as many developers out there.

Besides adding resources to our lists, we welcome bug fixes, typo fixes, and feedback! **However, we prioritize PRs from existing community members and underrepresented genders in tech to support our mission.**

We take our Code of Conduct very seriously, and all contributors must abide by it. So please take time to read it before contributing.

## New Contributors

If you're new to open source, check out the resources below to familiarize yourself with open source:

- [Our members' articles about open source on our website](https://www.shesharp.co/hacktoberfest)
- [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources)
- [Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)

## Working With Issues

If you find an issue you would like to work on, comment on it, and a maintainer will respond and assign it to you. Only work on changes and create a PR if it's assigned to you.

We only accept PRs from contributors who get assigned to the issues.

## Getting Started

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository) the forked repository to your local machine.
3. [Create a new branch](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch-and-checkout/) with a name related to your contribution, for example, `feat/add-resource`.
4. Work on your changes.
5. [Add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add#common-usages-and-options-for-git-add) and [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit#common-usages-and-options-for-git-commit) your changes with a descriptive commit message.
6. [Push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push#common-usages-and-options-for-git-push) the new branch to your remote forked repository.
7. Create and submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request).

## Resolve Merge Conflicts

When you encounter merge conflicts, you need to resolve them before your pull request can be merged into the `main` branch.

Merge conflicts usually occur when changes are on the same line(s) and file(s) from two different branches. It is common to encounter merge conflicts when contributing to open source.

You can [resolve the conflict directly on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github). But it's highly recommended to [resolve the conflicts locally](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).

## What if the Resource You would Add doesn't Fit any Existing Categories?

If the category that best fits your contribution doesn't yet exist, please create a new Markdown file in the `resources` folder and add it there. You also need to add the path to this new file to the "Resources" section in the `README.md`.

## Keep in Mind

Please be sure to keep the following in mind before adding a new resource:

- Make sure you added the resource to the correct category.
- We accept all resources, but most favorably, resources that you've used before or you know are of exceptional quality.
- Ensure your resource doesn't exist in the repo before contributing.
- Double-check to make sure the link to your resource is working.

And that's it!

With love, <br>
