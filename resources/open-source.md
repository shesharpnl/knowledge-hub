# Picture this

You've been learning how to code for a couple of months now and are tired of going through tutorial after tutorial. Just when you were about to give up on coding altogether, an angel appeared in a form of a tweet, "Try open source".

## What is Open Source?

Open source is when a product's code is made available to the public to the public, allowing people to make modifications to enhance them. This concept was found by Christine Peterson, an Executive Director at Foresight in 1998 to make this software more understandable to businesses and people who are not in tech. Want to learn more? Check out her blog post, ["How I coined the term 'open source"](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software).

## How can I benefit from Open Source?

In addition to growing your tech skills, participating in the open source community gives you the chance to:

- Work with others worldwide
- Develop your communication skills
- Experience that you can add to your resume(CV for individuals outside North America)
- Work you can showcase as samples on your portfolio
