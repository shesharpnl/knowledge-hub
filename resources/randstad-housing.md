# Randstad Housing Resources

Housing in the Netherlands can be challenging. Besides using our Slack channel to network with other home seekers/ potential flatmates, we've curated some resources to aid in the search for a rental home. Things to keep in mind when looking for a rental home:

- An energy label of C or higher is recommended.
- If subletting or renting a room/apartment from an owner, check whether you can register at the address.
- Apartments usually come in one of three ways: unfinished, unfurnished, or furnished.
- Unfinished apartments usually require the tenant to install flooring, light fixtures, and potentially appliances / a kitchen. They also tend to be cheaper. Finding a reliable handyman/contractor in the Netherlands is difficult, and this is especially true in Amsterdam.
- Unfurnished apartments have floors, sometimes ceiling lighting fixtures, and a kitchen. It is "finished."
- Furnished apartments have the above as well as furniture owned by the landlord. They usually require a deposit for the furniture, and often, landlords will not change the furniture. For example, if a tiny studio apartment has a giant dining table, do not expect the landlord to change it once you move in.

## Check Your Rent Price

Rental prices in the Randstad, particularly Amsterdam, tend to be egregiously expensive and often illegal. You can use the [Huurcommissie site](https://checkjeprijs.huurcommissie.nl/en/onderwerpen/huurprijs-en-punten/nieuwe-huurprijscheck/rent-check-independent-living-space) to check your rental price against the legal limit.
